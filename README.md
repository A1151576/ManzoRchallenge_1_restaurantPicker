Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Right off the bat the first answer I got was Taco Bell and that's literally what I'm eating right now so you definitely have some type of advanced algorithmic data mining going on which is impressive. Good use of a default switch satement to catch any inputs that might be out of range. You may want to tweak that in future revisions so that the user is immediately re-prompted for a food category instead of going straight to asking them to play again- just to save the user a step in the event of erroneous input. Good call on using lists to store each restaurant category. A lot of good options in there btw. One thing to remeber is that arrays start at an index of 0. So you likely want your random numbers to be generated "int swts = rand.Next(0, 8);" instead of the "(1, 8)" you currently have. Other than that really good job! I played a ton of times and had no luck breaking it and got some awesome recommendations along the way
